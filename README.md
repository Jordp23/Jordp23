## Hi there, I'm Jordy!

I'm a ✨CS Major✨ at University of Illinois Chicago. Ever since I took my very first coding class in high school, I discovered that I wanted to learn more about how computers think and how we as people interact with them to get them to perform the way we intend. 

This passion has led me to UIC, where I'm now learning Data Structures and Programming Practicum. I'm learning new coding languages while also trying to optimize my code to make it run more efficiently. 

My goal is to take my techinical skills to a Chicago-based company so that I can be useful in optimizing business operations. 

Languages: C++, C, and Java
